""" SCOPE """
#There exists a three-tiered structure to scope in Python:
#Built-in
#  Global
#    Local

#When you use a variable, Python will first look for it in the Local environment,
#then the Global environment, and finally the Built-in environment
import pandas as pd #pandas' content is now scoped at the Built-in level
from pandas import Series #Series is now scoped at the Global level

Series = "Hello" #We have masked pandas' version of Series

type(Series)
type(pd.Series) #We can still provide the namespace to specify which "Series" we're looking for

#If your variable isn't found in any environment, an error occurs:
print(candycane)

#%%
#This means that variables you create can obscure system functionality:
alist = ["a","b","c",1,2,3]

print("len(alist) is {}".format(len(alist)))

def len(x):
    return 8000

print("len(alist) is now {}".format(len(alist)))

#Run this cell again.  What happened?

#%%
#To delete a name you've created, use the del statement
del len

#%%
#We're currently in the global environment:  let's make some variables!
x = 10
y = 5

print("In the global environment x + y = {}".format(x+y))

def add10toX(x):
    x += 10
    #Note how we can still access y's value here.  Even though y doesn't exist 
    #in the local environment, we can still find it in the global one
    print("In our local function environment x + y = {}".format(x+y))
    return

add10toX(x)

#Note how the value of x in the global environment did not change.
#Since the function returned, the x from our function is gone!
print("Back in the global environment x + y = {}".format(x+y))

"""IMPLEMENT MERGE SORT"""

#Merge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm that operates in n log n time.
#Merge sort works on the fact that it is easier to sort a bunch of tiny lists
#Rather than sorting one giant list
#Base case:  1 element list is automatically sorted
#Step case:  We will split the list in half at each point, calling merge sort on both halves,
#and then combining the returned sorted sublists
alist = [5,2,55,1,99,87,23,41,1]
